## Work Done

I implemented all of the required elements.

I believe I have written some incredibly clean and readable code, specifically in the render section. All of the animations are clearly grouped and the functional programming helps to display the heirarchical structure of the project.

Also, I got normal maps working so those help to add some extra "realism" to the animation.

## Attribution

From A1, I re-used (and extended) `kyle.js` and `main.html`. `main.js` was also modified with many of the changes I made in A1.

Explanation and some code on normal maps came from this excellent writeup: https://apoorvaj.io/exploring-bump-mapping-with-webgl/
